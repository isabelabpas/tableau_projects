# Look and you'll see 👁️
My favorite visualization tool can be found here! While I've also had exposure to other softwares such as Looker Studio or PowerBI, I am most proficient in Tableau. 🤌  

Here you can find some samples of my dashboarding work.  
  
• 🏕️ [Adventure Works Project](https://github.com/isabelabpas/tableau_projects/tree/7a4031b6deb0238b24ea5ac84c5ea66067d0866f/Adventure%20Works%20Project): In this project, I built an interactive sales dashboard using Tableau to analyze AdventureWorks’ revenue, profit, and sales trends. I connected and prepared the data directly in Tableau, performing table joins, unions, and data transformations. I also created calculated fields to derive additional insights and structured the dashboard to display key performance indicators (KPIs), product performance, reseller performance, and regional sales trends. The final visualization allows stakeholders to explore sales metrics dynamically and make data-driven decisions.   
  
• 🧃 [Beverage Sales Dashboarding](https://github.com/isabelabpas/excel_projects/tree/main/Beverage%20Sales%20Project): This project involved creating an interactive dashboard in Excel to analyze beverage sales data. The data was first prepared using Tableau Prep, where data transformation techniques were applied, including creating calculated columns, performing table joins, and executing unions to consolidate the dataset. The transformed data was then imported into Excel, where pivot tables and pivot charts were designed for analysis. Using VBA, the dashboard was programmed for dynamic updates, enabling charts and tables to refresh automatically when new data was added. The final dashboard presents a simple interface for exploring sales trends.
