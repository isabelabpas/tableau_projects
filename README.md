• 🧃 [Beverage Sales Dashboarding](https://github.com/isabelabpas/excel_projects/tree/main/Beverage%20Sales%20Project): This project involved creating an interactive dashboard in Excel to analyze beverage sales data. The data was first prepared using Tableau Prep, where data transformation techniques were applied, including creating calculated columns, performing table joins, and executing unions to consolidate the dataset. The transformed data was then imported into Excel, where pivot tables and pivot charts were designed for analysis.

The final dashboard presents a simple interface for exploring sales trends.
